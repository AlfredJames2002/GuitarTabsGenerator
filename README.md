# GuitarTabsGenerator
Senior Project

This is the progress of my guitar tabs generator project. The idea is to generate guitar tabs from an uploaded song such that users can learn how to play said song on guitar.

## Steps
Seperate Source: ideally seperate guitar from the song or just the backgroud music if not guitar.

Predict Pitch: Detect both monophonic and Polyphonic pitch from guitar strums or plucks.

Generate Tabs: Convert pitch to notes and generate tabs using the notes and its onsets.

## Methods
Desktop app implemented in python. User interface will be created using tkinter.
